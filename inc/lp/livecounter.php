/**
 * This code implements a live user counter functionality. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
 *
 * 1. Sets up initial variables and checks for JavaScript mode.
 * 2. Defines helper functions for file operations and temporary directory access.
 * 3. Implements a function to count online users, categorized by user type.
 * 4. Creates a unique hash for each user based on their IP, user agent, and forwarded IP.
 * 5. Manages a temporary file to store user data.
 * 6. Records or updates user information in the temporary file.
 * 7. Cleans up inactive users based on a timeout.
 * 8. Outputs user count information in JavaScript format if requested.
 *
 * The code uses a file-based approach to track users, which may have scalability
 * limitations for high-traffic sites. It also directly accesses $_SERVER and $_REQUEST
 * variables, which could be made more secure.
 *
 * TODO: Refactor this code to use a more scalable approach (e.g., database storage),
 * implement proper input validation and sanitization, and follow WordPress coding standards.
